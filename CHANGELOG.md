# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Q2 2026 tracker keeps progress in `progress.md` instead of browser storage; every log is a git
  commit. Existing progress (153 sessions) migrated from Chrome.
- The tracker is serverless and hosted on GitHub Pages: it reads and commits `progress.md` through the
  GitHub API with a per-device token (Settings → GitHub sync), so it works from a phone. `server.py` is gone.
- Removed `jumpcut-editor.html`.
